1. The cards in the trello board are like each persons wallet
1. We need to create some type of authentication so that you only see your card. 
1. Pull from a text file that has all the dares and randomly assigns it to each person
1. pre-game it with submitting your own contextual dares
1. we need to save globally who completed what dare
1. (read where this database is getting written to)
